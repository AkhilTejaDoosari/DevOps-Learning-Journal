# 🚀 DevOps Daily Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository. This is where I document my **daily progress** through the DevOps ecosystem — starting with **Linux**, and moving into **AWS**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**, and beyond.

I'm committing to this journey daily to:

- 📈 Build discipline through consistent practice  
- 📓 Track and reinforce my growth publicly  
- 🌍 Share knowledge with the community — one `.md` file at a time

---

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Master core tools and workflows used in DevOps  
- ✅ Learn by doing, documenting real-world examples  
- ✅ Help others by keeping things clear and beginner-friendly
