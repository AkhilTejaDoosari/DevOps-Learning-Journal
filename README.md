# 🚀 DevOps Daily Learning Journey

Welcome to my **DevOps Learning Repository** — a living roadmap that documents my journey from absolute foundations to full-stack DevOps proficiency.
Every `.md` file in this repo is designed to **teach**, **clarify**, and **reinforce** concepts — so anyone can learn alongside me, from **Linux basics** to **Kubernetes orchestration**.

---

## 🌍 Why This Repository Exists

Most people chase tools before they understand how systems actually work.
This repository flips that mindset.

Here, I learn and document **from the inside out** — starting from the operating system level (Linux & Bash), moving up through version control, infrastructure, automation, and cloud architecture.

My goal:

> To help you **think like a DevOps Engineer**, not just follow tutorials.

Every section follows the same formula:

* **Why do we need this?**
* **How does it work in real life?**
* **Hands-on examples** (commands, screenshots, workflows)
* **Feynman-style explanations** (teach to remember)
* **Collapsible notes for revision**

## 🧩 Core Learning Pillars (Applies to Everything)

| Pillar                    | Description                                         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency**           | Daily commitment — 1% better every day              |
| **Learn by Doing**        | Every concept has practical application             |
| **Clarity First**         | Complex ideas → broken into beginner-friendly steps |
| **Architecture Thinking** | Always connect small tools to the bigger picture    |
| **Public Documentation**  | Notes built to help both me and others learn        |

## 🧠 Learning Framework

I follow these five learning principles across all modules:
1️⃣ **Pareto Principle (80/20)** – Focus on the vital few concepts that matter most.
2️⃣ **Parkinson’s Law** – Work expands to fill time; deadlines create progress.
3️⃣ **Feynman Technique** – Simplify until I can explain it clearly.
4️⃣ **Learn by Doing** – Theory means nothing without practice.
5️⃣ **Feedback Loop** – Revise, test, and refine continuously.

## 🏗️ DevOps Curriculum Overview

Below is the **complete syllabus** — the same order I follow to build end-to-end DevOps understanding.
Each topic folder contains detailed Markdown notes, diagrams, examples, and command breakdowns.

---

### **Phase 1 — Linux Foundations 🐧**

Learn the operating system that powers almost all DevOps workflows.

**Includes:**

* Linux boot process & file system
* Shell navigation, permissions, and process management
* Package management (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`)
* Systemd & service management
* Shell scripting (variables, loops, conditionals, automation)
* Networking basics (DNS, TCP/IP, ports, ping, traceroute)
* Monitoring tools (`top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `netstat`)

> *Goal:* Become fully comfortable in Linux CLI — your DevOps command center.

---

### **Phase 2 — Bash & Automation Scripts**

Move from typing commands to automating workflows.

**Includes:**

* Shell scripting fundamentals
* Functions, arguments, environment variables
* Scheduling (cron jobs)
* Log parsing using `awk`, `sed`, and redirection
* Writing reusable DevOps helper scripts

> *Goal:* Automate repetitive admin tasks and build confidence in scripting logic.

---

### **Phase 3 — Git & Version Control**

Master collaboration and version tracking — the foundation of CI/CD.

**Includes:**

* Git basics: `init`, `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
* Branching, merging, resolving conflicts
* GitHub workflows & pull requests
* `.gitignore`, tags, and versioning
* Real DevOps workflows with GitOps principles

> *Goal:* Manage code like a professional and collaborate confidently.

---

### **Phase 4 — AWS (Inside-Out Architect Approach)**

Learn AWS from the inside out — not by memorization, but by **how services actually connect**.

#### **Phase 1 – Security & Network**

1️⃣ IAM → Users, Roles, Policies *(who can access what)*
2️⃣ VPC + Subnets → Network layout, CIDR, Security Groups *(where things live)*

#### **Phase 2 – Storage Foundations**

3️⃣ EBS + Snapshots + EFS → Block & shared storage for EC2
4️⃣ S3 → Object storage, versioning, hosting

#### **Phase 3 – Compute + Database**

5️⃣ EC2 → Virtual machines that use IAM, VPC & EBS
6️⃣ RDS → Managed database connected to EC2 inside VPC

#### **Phase 4 – Resilience & Scaling**

7️⃣ Load Balancer + Auto Scaling → Distribute traffic & handle load automatically

#### **Phase 5 – Automation & Monitoring**

8️⃣ CloudWatch + Lambda + Beanstalk → Monitoring + serverless automation
9️⃣ Route 53 + CloudFormation → DNS + Infrastructure as Code

➡️ **Flow:** IAM → VPC → EBS → S3 → EC2 → RDS → Load Balancer → Auto Scaling → CloudWatch → Lambda → Route 53 → CloudFormation

> *Goal:* Understand AWS as a living architecture, not a checklist of services.

---

### **Phase 5 — Containers & Orchestration**

Docker and Kubernetes — build, ship, and run applications anywhere.

**Includes:**

* **Docker:** Images, containers, volumes, networking, Dockerfiles
* **Kubernetes (K8s):** Pods, Deployments, Services, ReplicaSets, Ingress, ConfigMaps
* **Helm basics:** Simplify deployment management

> *Goal:* Learn containerization and orchestration to scale modern apps.

---

### **Phase 6 — Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

Define and deploy infrastructure through code using Terraform and Ansible.

**Includes:**

* **Terraform:** Providers, state files, variables, and modules
* **Ansible:** Playbooks, inventory, roles, YAML syntax
* **AWS Integration:** Deploy EC2, S3, and networking with IaC
* **CI/CD pipelines:** Automate IaC validation and deployment

> *Goal:* Manage servers, networks, and apps declaratively — not manually.

---

### **Phase 7 — CI/CD & Automation**

Integrate everything together for smooth deployment pipelines.

**Includes:**

* Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI
* Build → Test → Deploy workflows
* Integrating Docker, Terraform, and AWS steps
* Blue-Green & Canary deployments

> *Goal:* Achieve automated, repeatable, and reliable software delivery.

---

### **Phase 8 — Observability & Maintenance**

Monitor, log, and alert for proactive infrastructure management.

**Includes:**

* CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana basics
* Log aggregation and alerting
* Incident response strategies

> *Goal:* Build visibility into every layer of your stack.
