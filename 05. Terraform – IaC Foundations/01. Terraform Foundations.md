<summary><strong>1. The World Before IaC</strong></summary>
<div style="margin-left: 12px;">
Before Terraform, teams built cloud systems by clicking around the console — launching an EC2 here, creating a subnet there, adjusting a security group at midnight. It worked, but nothing was written down. Every environment depended on someone’s memory.

If you tried to recreate the setup later, there was no guarantee it would match. One engineer remembered a setting; another didn’t. Something that “worked yesterday” might behave differently today simply because a small detail got lost somewhere.

It’s like building a house with no drawings. Each person guesses where the walls go. The first version might stand. The second? Probably different. The third? Nobody knows.

That became cloud infrastructure:
working, but fragile, with no clear history or repeatable design.

Terraform — and IaC as a whole — arrived to bring order into that chaos.

<summary><strong>2. Infrastructure as Code</strong></summary>

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is simply the idea of describing your cloud setup in text instead of clicking it into existence.
Think of it as writing down the design of a room before furnishing it.

You describe:

* what you want,
* how many pieces,
* the shape,
* and how everything connects.

Once the description exists, anyone can recreate the same setup without guessing.
It becomes consistent, reviewable, and versioned.

IaC does for infrastructure what Git did for software:
it brings clarity, history, and repeatability.

You don’t need to memorize anything — the code becomes the memory.
Terraform is one of the best tools built around this idea.

<summary><strong>3. What Terraform Really Is</strong></summary>
&nbsp;
Terraform is a **tool that builds what you describe**, not a tool you give step-by-step instructions to.

When you write a `.tf` file, you’re basically saying:

> “Here is the end result I want.  
> Please figure out the steps to create it.”  

Terraform reads your description, checks what already exists in the cloud, and then calculates exactly what needs to change to reach the target.

You don't tell Terraform *how* to do the work — you tell it *what the final picture* should look like. Terraform handles the details.

At a simple level, think of Terraform as:

* your “project manager”
* reading your design
* inspecting what’s already built
* and deciding the safest way to get from here to there

That’s the whole idea.
Terraform is a tool driven by intent, not instructions.

<summary><strong>4. How Terraform Sees Your Cloud</strong></summary>

Terraform understands your setup using a few simple ideas that work the same every time.

**Providers**   
These are like “language packs” that teach Terraform how to talk to AWS. Terraform doesn’t know what a VPC or EC2 is until the AWS provider explains it.

**Resources**  
These are the actual items you want — the building blocks.
A subnet, a bucket, an EC2 instance.
Each resource is simply “one thing you want in your setup.”

**Desired State**  
This is the picture you draw in your `.tf` files.
It’s not actions — it’s the final shape of what you want built.

**State**  
This is Terraform’s notebook.
It remembers what was created last time — IDs, settings, and details AWS returned.
Without this memory, Terraform would have no idea what already exists.

Terraform compares:

* what you want,  
* what you already have,  
* and what AWS reports right now.  

From that comparison, Terraform figures out what to change.

That’s really all it is.

<summary><strong>5. The Terraform Workflow</strong></summary>

Terraform follows a simple, predictable rhythm.

You write your configuration — your design.  
`terraform init` prepares the environment so Terraform can talk to AWS.  
`terraform plan` shows the difference between your description and the current setup.  
`terraform apply` performs the changes in the correct order.  
`terraform destroy` removes everything Terraform created.  

This rhythm never changes.
It’s designed to feel safe and clear: Terraform always shows the plan before touching anything.

Once you understand this loop, Terraform stops feeling like a tool and starts feeling like a process you already know.

<summary><strong>6. Core Terraform Files</strong></summary>

Terraform projects revolve around a few familiar files — nothing complicated.

`main.tf` — where your main resources live.  
`providers.tf` — how Terraform connects to AWS.  
`variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` — simple ways to make your config flexible and reusable.  
`terraform.tfstate` — Terraform’s memory from past runs.  
`terraform.tfvars` — values for specific environments.  

Think of these files as the basic shelves and compartments of your setup.
Once you know where things go, everything else makes sense.

### **How Terraform Thinks**

```
     Your Description (.tf)
             |
             v
      Terraform Engine
     (Compares + Plans)
             |
             v
   Real AWS Infrastructure
             ^
             |
     terraform.tfstate
```

Terraform stays outside the cloud —
looking at what you want
and what you have
before making any move.

Terraform’s mental model is simple:
* You describe the goal,
* Terraform checks reality,
* and it adjusts things to match.

Clarity replaces effort.
Once infrastructure becomes something you *describe* instead of something you *assemble*, everything becomes easier to build, repeat, and trust.

Terraform is simply the tool that makes that clarity real.
