# Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Our network is now set ‚Äî roads, gates, and rules are ready.
But a server can‚Äôt run without storage to hold its data.
That‚Äôs where EBS (Elastic Block Store) comes in.
Think of it as attaching an SSD to your EC2 instance ‚Äî local, fast, and always there when you restart the machine.

<summary><strong>1. What Is EBS?</strong></summary>

**Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a **persistent block storage** service designed for Amazon EC2 instances.  
Each EBS volume behaves like a **virtual hard drive** ‚Äî you can format it, mount it, detach it, and re-attach it to other EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone (AZ).

Even if you stop or restart your instance, **the data remains intact**, making EBS a reliable storage layer for OS files, applications, and databases.

üí° **Analogy (minimal use):**  
Think of EBS as a **detachable SSD** for your EC2 instance ‚Äî you can unplug it, carry it to another machine in the same data center (AZ), and plug it back in without losing your data.

**Key properties:**
- **Persistent**: Data survives instance stop/start.
- **Block-level**: You manage it like a raw disk.
- **Flexible**: You can increase size, change performance, or migrate without downtime.
- **AZ-scoped**: Must be in the same Availability Zone as the instance.

<summary><strong>2. How EBS Works with EC2</strong></summary>

EBS volumes attach to EC2 instances over the **availability zone network**.  
When you launch an EC2 instance, it can have:
- **Root Volume:** Stores OS and boot files.
- **Additional Data Volumes:** For app data, logs, or databases.

**High-level flow:**

```

EBS Volume  <‚îÄ‚îÄattached‚îÄ‚îÄ>  EC2 Instance
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Snapshots stored in S3 (for backup & cloning)

```

- EBS is **replicated automatically within its AZ** to prevent data loss.
- You can attach **multiple EBS volumes** to one EC2, or attach a single EBS volume to multiple EC2s (only for io1/io2 Multi-Attach use cases).

üí° **Use Case Examples:**
- Root volume for Linux/Windows OS.
- Application data storage for web servers.
- Database storage (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Persistent log storage or caching layer.

<summary><strong>2.1  Special Case ‚Äì EBS Multi-Attach (io1 / io2 Volumes)</strong></summary>

Normally, a single EBS volume can be **attached to only one EC2 instance at a time**.  
That keeps data consistent, just like plugging a physical SSD into one machine.

However, the **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2)** volume types introduce a feature called **Multi-Attach**.  
It lets you connect the same volume to **up to 16 EC2 instances** *simultaneously* within the **same Availability Zone**.

üí° **Why this exists:**  
Some enterprise or clustered applications (for example, Oracle RAC or shared file systems) need multiple servers to read and write to the same shared disk.  
Multi-Attach gives them a common block-level layer while keeping latency extremely low.

‚öôÔ∏è **How it behaves**
- Every attached EC2 gets a unique device name (e.g., `/dev/sdf`, `/dev/sdg` ‚Ä¶).  
- All instances see the **same data blocks** in real time.  
- There‚Äôs **no built-in locking** ‚Äî your application must manage concurrent writes safely (through a clustered file system or DB engine).  
- If ordinary servers try to write at the same time without coordination, data corruption can occur.

üß≠ **Architect‚Äôs Note:**  
Use Multi-Attach only when your workload is explicitly designed for shared block access.  
For general cases, treat EBS as a **one-to-one disk** between an instance and its volume ‚Äî simpler, faster, safer.

<summary><strong>3. EBS Volume Types</strong></summary>

| Volume Type | Medium | Description | Best For |
|--------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **gp3** | SSD | General-purpose SSD with configurable IOPS (up to 16,000) and throughput (up to 1,000 MB/s). | Most workloads ‚Äì OS, applications, boot volumes |
| **io2/io1** | SSD | Provisioned IOPS SSD with consistent latency and Multi-Attach support. | High-performance databases |
| **st1** | HDD | Throughput-optimized HDD for large sequential workloads. | Big data, logs, streaming workloads |
| **sc1** | HDD | Cold HDD with lowest cost and lowest performance. | Archival and infrequently accessed data |

üí° **Tip:**  
Use **gp3** by default unless you have a clear reason to optimize for either IOPS (io2/io1) or cost (st1/sc1).

üìò **Durability:**  
EBS volumes provide **99.999% availability** within an AZ due to internal replication.

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Snapshots & Backup Mechanism</strong></summary>

A **snapshot** is a **point-in-time backup** of an EBS volume stored in Amazon S3.  
Although stored in S3, snapshots are managed transparently by EBS.

```

EBS Volume ‚Üí Snapshot ‚Üí New Volume

```

- **First snapshot** = full copy  
- **Subsequent snapshots** = incremental (only changed blocks)
- Snapshots can be **used to create new volumes**, **copied across regions**, or **automated via Lifecycle Manager**.

üí° **Analogy:**  
It‚Äôs like taking a **photo of your disk‚Äôs current state**.  
If anything breaks later, you can rebuild an exact copy using that snapshot.

üì∏ **Reference:** [EBS Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Cross-AZ and Cross-Region Copy</strong></summary>

You can use snapshots to **clone volumes** across Availability Zones or Regions.

### Cross-AZ (within same region)
1. Create a snapshot of the source volume (e.g., `us-east-1a`).
2. Use that snapshot to create a new volume in another AZ (e.g., `us-east-1b`).
3. Attach it to an EC2 instance there.

### Cross-Region
1. Copy the snapshot to another region.
2. Create a volume from that copy.
3. Attach to EC2 in the destination region.

üí° **Analogy:**  
It‚Äôs like **replicating your disk** to a different branch office ‚Äî same setup, new location.

<summary><strong>6. EBS Encryption</strong></summary>

EBS provides **encryption at rest and in transit** using **AWS KMS** (Key Management Service).  
You can use **AWS-managed keys (aws/ebs)** or **customer-managed CMKs**.

**Key points:**
- Encrypted data stays encrypted during I/O operations.
- Snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.
- New volumes created from encrypted snapshots remain encrypted.
- Enable **EBS encryption by default** in your account for consistency.

üìò **Command:**
```bash
aws ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default
````

üì∏ **Reference:** [EBS Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html)

<details>
<summary><strong>7. Modifying Volumes (Resize, Migrate, Tune)</strong></summary>

You can dynamically **resize** or **change** EBS volume attributes without detaching it.

**Options you can modify:**

* Size (GB)
* IOPS
* Throughput (for gp3)

**After resizing:**

* Extend partition and filesystem inside the OS (`growpart`, `xfs_growfs`).

**Migration approach:**

* Create snapshot ‚Üí New volume (different type or region) ‚Üí Attach ‚Üí Sync data.

üìò **Example command:**

```bash
aws ec2 modify-volume --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef --size 200 --iops 8000 --throughput 600
```

<summary><strong>8. Performance Essentials (IOPS & Throughput)</strong></summary>

**IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)** ‚Üí speed for small random reads/writes.
**Throughput (MB/s)** ‚Üí speed for large sequential data transfers.

| Metric     | gp3 (max)  | io2 (max)             | st1/sc1              |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| IOPS       | 16,000     | 256,000 (provisioned) | Low                  |
| Throughput | 1,000 MB/s | 4,000 MB/s            | High sequential only |
| Latency    | ~5 ms      | <1 ms                 | High (HDD latency)   |

üí° **Tip:**
Monitor performance using **CloudWatch metrics** like `VolumeReadOps`, `VolumeWriteOps`, `VolumeThroughputPercentage`, etc.

<summary><strong>9. Best Practices & Cost Optimization</strong></summary>

‚úÖ Use **gp3** for most workloads (better performance per $).
‚úÖ Set **volume and snapshot tags** for cost tracking.
‚úÖ Enable **EBS Lifecycle Manager** to automatically delete old snapshots.
‚úÖ For large-scale systems, **align IOPS with EC2 bandwidth** to avoid bottlenecks.
‚úÖ Use **RAID 0** (striping) for high I/O and **RAID 1** (mirroring) for durability if needed.
‚úÖ Always **unmount before detaching** volumes to avoid data corruption.
