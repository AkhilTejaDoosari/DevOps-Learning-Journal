# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)

EBS works great inside one zone, but sometimes data needs to travel — backups, media, global access.
That’s where S3 (Simple Storage Service) takes over.
Instead of local disks, it’s like a giant warehouse in the cloud — infinite shelves where any app can drop a file and pick it from anywhere on the planet.

<summary><strong>1. Why Do We Need S3?</strong></summary>

EBS volumes are reliable but tied to one instance in one zone.  
They’re perfect for operating systems or databases — not for global sharing.  

When applications grow, you need a place where:
- Any service can store or fetch data, anytime.
- Capacity expands automatically.
- Costs depend on how much you store.

That’s **Amazon S3** — an object-storage service that acts like a limitless data vault.  
You can store photos, backups, code, logs, or even full websites — pay only for what you use.

<summary><strong>2. Analogy – The Infinite Warehouse</strong></summary>

Think of S3 as an **endless warehouse** in the cloud.  
Each **bucket** is a storage room with its own label.  
Every file you drop inside becomes an **object**, tagged with a unique barcode (its URL).

You can walk in, store or retrieve any object from anywhere in the world.  
Unlike an EBS disk, this warehouse has no walls, no cables — just infinite shelves that never fill up.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. Core Concept – Buckets and Objects</strong></summary>

- You create **buckets** to organize data. Each bucket name must be globally unique.  
- Inside a bucket, every uploaded **object** is stored with:
  - **Key** → the file name / path  
  - **Value** → file data  
  - **Metadata** → object info  
  - **Version ID** (if versioning is on)

S3 automatically replicates data across devices in the same region for durability (11 nines).

Example URL:
```

[https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/image.png](https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/image.png)

```

💡 *Architect’s Note:*  
S3 is a **global service**, but buckets are **region-specific**.  
Pick regions closer to your users to reduce latency.

<details>
<summary><strong>4. Bucket Naming Rules</strong></summary>

| Rule | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Length | 3 – 63 characters |
| Characters | a-z, 0-9, period (.), hyphen (-) |
| Must start/end with | Letter or number |
| Global uniqueness | No two buckets share the same name |
| Forbidden | Uppercase, underscores, or spaces |

💡 Tip: For websites, match your bucket name to your domain (e.g., `chillspot-media.com`).

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Static Website Hosting</strong></summary>

S3 can host **static websites** — sites made of HTML, CSS, and JS files that look identical for all users.

**Steps:**
1. Create a bucket (often named after your domain).  
2. Upload your website files (`index.html`, `error.html`).  
3. Enable **Static Website Hosting** under *Properties*.  
4. Provide the index and error documents.  
5. Make objects publicly readable.  
6. Access your site via the generated endpoint URL.

Example endpoint:  
`http://chillspot-website.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

📘 *Modern tip:* For production, use **AWS Amplify** or **CloudFront** for performance and HTTPS.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Versioning</strong></summary>

Think of versioning as an **undo button** for your bucket.  
When enabled, every new upload of the same object keeps the previous version rather than replacing it.

**Default:** Disabled (new file overwrites the old one).  
**Enabled:** S3 preserves all versions.  
**Suspended:** Keeps existing versions but stops new ones.

**Why it matters in DevOps:**  
- Recover from accidental deletes or overwrites.  
- Track configuration file history or deployment artifacts.  
- Combine with Lifecycle policies to expire old versions automatically.

<summary><strong>7. Storage Classes with Scenarios</strong></summary>

Different data deserves different storage costs.  
Here’s how each S3 storage class fits a real-world use case:

| Storage Class | When to Use | Real Scenario |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Standard** | Frequently accessed data | Website images, app assets, or user uploads accessed every day. |
| **Intelligent-Tiering** | Unknown or changing access patterns | Logs and reports whose popularity changes — S3 auto-moves them between hot/cold tiers. |
| **Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** | Accessed once or twice a month | Monthly analytics exports, historical sales reports. |
| **One Zone-IA** | Rarely used and easily reproducible | Cached data or thumbnails that can be recreated anytime. |
| **Glacier Instant Retrieval** | Archives needed quarterly with instant access | Marketing footage or past project files that must be instantly restored. |
| **Glacier Flexible Retrieval** | Long-term archives, retrieved occasionally | Tax filings or compliance documents you access once a year. |
| **Glacier Deep Archive** | Long-term retention, rarely accessed | 7-year legal backups or raw sensor data for audit purposes. |
| **Reduced Redundancy** | Legacy option (not recommended) | Old, non-critical assets; replaced by Standard class today. |

🧭 *Architect’s rule:* Match **frequency of access** with **cost of storage** —  
frequent = Standard; rare = Glacier.

<summary><strong>7.1  Pricing and Bucket Design Strategy</strong></summary>

### 💰 How S3 Billing Actually Works
S3 pricing depends on **what you store and how you use it**, not on how many buckets you create.

| Charged For | Example |
|--------------|----------|
| **Storage (GB per month)** | Total size of all objects in all buckets |
| **Requests** | PUT / GET / COPY / DELETE calls made to S3 |
| **Data Transfer Out** | Data leaving S3 to the Internet or another AWS Region |
| **Optional Features** | Replication, Inventory, Analytics, Object Lock, etc. |

➡️ You **do not** pay for:  
- Number of buckets  
- Number of folders  
- How many EC2 instances access them  

If you store **1 TB** of data—whether it lives in one bucket or ten—the cost is identical.

---

### 🧩 Multiple Buckets vs One Big Bucket

| Approach | Pros | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Single bucket with folders** | Simpler to manage, one policy to maintain | Harder to apply different lifecycle or security rules |
| **Separate buckets per data type** | Clear boundaries for policy and lifecycle; easy cost breakdown | Slightly more management overhead, but no extra charges |

💬 **Example:**  
- `chillspot-media` → movies & shows (Standard → IA)  
- `chillspot-logs`   → app logs (Intelligent-Tiering → Glacier)  
- `chillspot-backups` → database exports (Deep Archive)

All together they cost the same as one huge bucket—only the **usage** matters.

---

### ⚙️ EC2 and S3 Interaction Costs
S3 isn’t “attached” like EBS; EC2 accesses it via the S3 API (HTTPS).

| Scenario | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| EC2 ↔ S3 in same region | Free for inbound and most outbound traffic |
| EC2 ↔ S3 cross-region | Inter-region data transfer fees apply |
| EC2 ↔ S3 via Internet (no VPC endpoint) | Charged as Internet egress per GB |

---

### 🧭 Architect’s Guideline
- Use **multiple buckets** if you need different security or retention rules.  
- Use **one bucket with folders** for simpler projects.  
- Always keep S3 and EC2 in the same region to avoid transfer charges.  
- Tag buckets to track cost by project or environment.

**Summary:**  
> S3 billing cares about bytes, requests, and transfers — not bucket count.  
> Design buckets for clarity, not for cost.

<summary><strong>8. Security & Access Control</strong></summary>

S3 security is multi-layered:

1. **IAM Policies** → Who can access S3 resources.  
2. **Bucket Policies** → What specific actions are allowed or denied at bucket level.  
3. **ACLs** → Object-level access (legacy, rarely used).  
4. **Block Public Access** → Global safeguard against accidental exposure.  
5. **Encryption** → Protects data both at rest (AES-256 / KMS) and in transit (HTTPS).

💡 Always use **IAM roles** for EC2 or Lambda to grant temporary, secure access instead of embedding keys.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>9. Lifecycle Management</strong></summary>

As data ages, its value often drops.  
**Lifecycle rules** let you automate storage transitions and deletions.

Example policy ideas:
- Move logs to **Glacier** after 30 days.  
- Delete old object versions after 90 days.  
- Permanently remove expired data after 1 year.

This keeps S3 lean, cost-efficient, and self-maintaining.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary><strong>10. Encryption & Consistency</strong></summary>

- **At Rest:** S3 encrypts objects with AES-256 (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS (SSE-KMS).  
- **In Transit:** Uses HTTPS/TLS for secure uploads and downloads.  
- **Data Consistency:** Offers strong read-after-write consistency for all PUT and DELETE operations.

These features make S3 safe for both personal data and enterprise-grade workloads.

<details>
<summary><strong>11. Real Example – ChillSpot Media Flow</strong></summary>

In **StarkWolf’s ChillSpot**, every movie file sits inside an S3 bucket — secure, versioned, and globally accessible.  
When a user presses “Play,” the app fetches metadata (title, rating, genre) from **RDS**,  
then streams the video directly from **S3** through a pre-signed URL.  

This separation keeps:
- **RDS** focused on lightweight queries,  
- **S3** handling heavy media storage,  
- **EC2** running business logic.

That’s the trio powering most modern streaming platforms.

**In short:**
S3 is not just “cloud storage” — it’s the backbone of the Internet’s data layer.
While EC2 runs your applications, **S3 remembers everything** — safely, infinitely, and affordably.
