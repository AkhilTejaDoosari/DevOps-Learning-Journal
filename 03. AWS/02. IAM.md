# IAM (Identity and Access Management)

We’ve seen what AWS really is — a planet of servers, storage, and networks you can rent on demand.
But before we start building anything on it, we need to decide who gets the keys and what doors they can open.
That’s where IAM (Identity and Access Management) steps in — the service that defines people, roles, and boundaries inside this cloud world.

## 1. Why Do We Need IAM?

Imagine AWS as a huge company building full of resources — EC2 machines, S3 storage rooms, databases, and more.  
Without IAM, **anyone with the root account** could wander around, touch everything, and accidentally delete critical servers.  
That’s where IAM steps in — it’s your **security department**, giving each person a personalized keycard that unlocks only what they need.

---

### 2. Analogy

Think of **AWS as a company building**:  
- The **Root user** is the **company owner** — full control over everything.  
- **IAM Users** are **employees** with their own ID cards to enter the building.  
- **Groups** are **departments** like *Developers* or *Finance*, each with specific duties.  
- **Policies** are the **rules** that define what each department or user can access.  
- **Roles** are **temporary visitor passes** for people or systems that need short-term access.  
- **MFA** is like a **security guard** asking for a second proof before entry.  

> 🧠 IAM is the security department of your AWS company — it decides *who gets in*, *what doors they can open*, and *how safely they can move around.*

## 3. Concept Understanding

### IAM is Global
IAM isn’t tied to any AWS region — the settings apply across all regions.

### 🧍 Users
- **Users** represent individual people or specific services that need access to your AWS account.  
- Each user gets their own **credentials** — a unique username, password, and (optionally) access keys for programmatic access.  
- This separation keeps actions traceable to specific individuals, improving **security** and **accountability**.  
- Example:  
  - `alice` might use the console to manage EC2 instances.  
  - `build-server` (a service user) might use access keys to deploy applications automatically.  
- **Best practice:** *One user = One human or service.* Never share credentials between people.


### 👥 Groups
- **Groups** are collections of IAM users who share similar job roles or responsibilities.  
- Instead of assigning permissions to each user one by one, you assign them to a **group** — and all members automatically inherit those permissions.  
- This makes access control **organized**, **scalable**, and **easy to audit**.  
- Example:  
  - The `Developers` group has the **AmazonEC2FullAccess** policy.  
  - Any new developer added to the group instantly gets EC2 permissions — no extra setup needed.  
- A user can belong to **multiple groups** (e.g., `Developers` and `Audit-Team`), combining permissions from both.

### 📜 Policies
- **Policies** are permission documents written in **JSON** that define what actions are **allowed** or **denied** in AWS.  
- They decide **who can do what** and on **which resources**.  
- Policies can be attached to **users**, **groups**, or **roles** to grant specific levels of access.  
- Each policy is made up of key fields:  
  - **Effect:** Allow or Deny  
  - **Action:** The specific AWS service operations (e.g., `ec2:StartInstances`)  
  - **Resource:** The AWS resources those actions apply to  
- Example: A “ReadOnlyAccess” policy allows viewing resources but blocks any changes.

### 🧩 Roles

- **What it is:**  
  An **IAM Role** is a **temporary identity** that carries specific permissions.  
  Unlike IAM Users, roles **don’t have long-term credentials** (no password or access keys).  
  Instead, AWS issues **short-lived security tokens** whenever a role is **assumed**, and they expire automatically.

---

- **Why we need it:**  
  Storing permanent access keys inside applications or servers is unsafe.  
  Roles solve this by letting AWS generate **temporary credentials** automatically, which are **rotated** and **expire** after a short duration.  
  This greatly reduces the risk of compromised keys.

---
- **How it works (simplified flow):**  
  1. The user, service, or application requests to **assume** a role.  
  2. **AWS STS** issues temporary credentials — `AccessKeyId`, `SecretAccessKey`, and `SessionToken`.  
  3. The entity uses these credentials to access AWS resources.  
  4. Credentials **expire automatically** (default: 1 hour), removing access safely.

---

- **Why it’s safer:**  
  - No permanent credentials stored inside applications or servers.  
  - Temporary, auto-rotating tokens limit the blast radius if compromised.  
  - Enforces **least privilege** and **session-based access control**.

---
### 🎬 Simplified Analogy

Imagine a movie set:

- **IAM User** = the **actor** (their normal self)  
- **IAM Role** = the **costume** (grants temporary powers for that scene)  
- **STS (Security Token Service)** = the **wardrobe department** that issues the costume and takes it back later  

Actors — whether humans or AWS services — can wear different **costumes (roles)** depending on what the **scene (task)** needs.  
When the scene ends, the costume is returned and access expires automatically.

---
- **Who can wear Roles:**  

  | Who Wears It | Description | Example |
  |---------------|--------------|----------|
  | 🧍 **IAM User (Human)** | A person manually switches to a different role for temporary elevated permissions. | A developer switches to `AdminRole` for maintenance, then returns to normal user access. |
  | ⚙️ **AWS Service** | A service automatically assumes a role to access other AWS resources securely. | An **EC2 instance** assumes a role to read/write data in an **S3 bucket** without storing credentials. |
  | 🔁 **Another AWS Account** | Roles can be shared between AWS accounts through a **trust policy** (cross-account access). | **Account A** allows **Account B** to assume a role to manage shared infrastructure. |
  | 🤖 **Application / Script / CLI** | Code or automation pipelines assume roles using **AWS STS (Security Token Service)**. | A **CI/CD pipeline** assumes a `DeployRole` to push new versions to production. |

---

- **Best Practice:**  
  > Humans use **Users**. AWS services use **Roles**. Always apply the **least privilege** principle.  

---

- **Coming up next:**  
  > We’ll see IAM Roles *in action* in the **EC2** and **Lambda** sections — where services automatically assume roles to access other AWS resources securely.

### ⚙️ In Action Example: EC2 Using a Role to Access S3

1. **Create a Role**  
   - Example permission:  
     ```json
     {
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Action": "s3:GetObject",
       "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
     }
     ```
   - This policy allows reading objects from the S3 bucket.

2. **Attach the Role to an EC2 Instance**  
   - When the instance launches, it automatically **assumes** this role.

3. **Automatic Credential Retrieval**  
   - Inside the EC2 instance, your application (Python script, AWS CLI, etc.) can now access S3 **without storing access keys**.  
   - Behind the scenes, the instance retrieves **temporary credentials** through the **Instance Metadata Service (IMDS)** at:
     ```
     http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
     ```

4. **Result:**  
   - The EC2 instance can safely download or upload to the S3 bucket.  
   - Credentials are **temporary**, **auto-rotated**, and **never hard-coded** inside your code.

> 🧠 This demonstrates the core purpose of IAM Roles — **secure, short-lived, and automatic access** between AWS services without manually handling keys.

### 🏁 Best Practices
1. **Never use root account** for daily tasks  
2. **Use groups** to manage permissions at scale  
3. **Regularly audit permissions** (remove unused access)  
4. **Enable MFA** for all users  
5. **Apply least privilege principle**

### 🎯 Excerise:
Create an IAM user, add it to a group, attach policies, test access, and secure it with MFA.

---

### **Step 1: Open IAM Console**
1. Log in as the **root user** → [https://aws.amazon.com/console](https://aws.amazon.com/console)  
2. Search for **IAM** in the service bar.  
3. Observe the **IAM Dashboard** — it shows account summary, MFA status, and security recommendations.  

📸 Screenshot →   
<img src="images/IAM_Dashboard.png" />

---

### **Step 2: Create a New User**
1. In the left sidebar → click **Users → Add users**.  

📸 Screenshot →     
<img src="images/IAM_adduser.png" />   

2. Enter username: `devops-user`.  
3. Check **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console**.  
4. Choose **Custom password**, uncheck “Require password reset.”  
5. Click **Next**.  

📸 Screenshot →   
<img src="images/IAM_userdetials.png" />

---

### **Step 3: Create a Group and Assign Permissions**
1. Choose **Add user to group → Create group.**  

📸 Screenshot →     
<img src="images/IAM_creatgroup.png" />

2. Name the group: `DevOps-Admins`.  
3. From the policy list, select **AdministratorAccess.**  
   - This gives full permissions across AWS services — ideal for admin-level users.  
   - *(For learning environments, you can later replace this with a custom least-privilege policy.)*  
4. Click **Create group** → select it → click **Next** → **Create user.**

📸 Screenshot →     
<img src="images/IAM_groupcreation.png" />

5. After the user is created, you’ll see the **Retrieve password** screen.  
   It displays your **sign-in URL**, **username**, and **temporary password**.  

📸 Screenshot →  
<img src="images/IAM_Retrieve password.png" />

6. Click **“Download .csv file.”**  
   - This file contains your new user’s **username**, **password**, and **sign-in URL.**  
   - Save it somewhere **secure** (e.g., a private folder, not GitHub or shared drives).  
   - ⚠️ You will **not** be able to view this password again later.

7. *(Optional but Recommended)* — Click **“Email sign-in instructions.”**  
   - This opens an email template to send login details securely to yourself.

8. Click **“Return to users list.”**  
   - You’ll be redirected to the **IAM → Users** page.  
   - You’ll now see your new user **`Devops_Admin`** listed successfully.
---

### **Step 4: Log In as IAM User**
1. Copy the **Sign-in URL** displayed after user creation (looks like:  
   `https://<account-id>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`).  
2. Log out from root and log in with:  
   - Username: `Devops_Admin`  
   - Password: your custom password  
3. You should now see the full AWS Console as an IAM Administrator.

<img src="images/IAM_devopsadmin.png" />
---

### **Step 5: Test Permissions**

1. Open **EC2**, **S3**, **IAM**, and other services — your `Devops_Admin` user should have **full access** to all AWS services.  
2. To test least privilege, create another IAM user with restricted access:  
   - Go to **IAM → Users → Add users.**  
   - Enter username: `teja`  
   - Provide console access (same as before).  
   - Set a **custom password** (optional: uncheck “Require password reset”).  
   - Click **Next.**
3. Choose **Add user to group → Create group.**  
   - Name the group: `Developers`  
   - Attach the following **AWS Managed Policies:**  
     - `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`  
     - `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`  
     - `IAMReadOnlyAccess`  
   - Click **Create group → Next → Create user.**

📸 Screenshot →   
<img src="images/group_dev.png">

4. Log in using the new user credentials for `teja`:  
   - **Sign-in URL:** `https://735189763643.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`  
   - **Username:** `teja`  
   - **Password:** (from your downloaded .csv file)
5. Test permissions:  
   - Open **EC2**, **S3**, and **IAM** — you should be able to **view** resources but **cannot create, edit, or delete** them.  
   - This confirms that your `Developers` group and Read-Only policies are working correctly.

<img src="images/access_denied.png">

6. Switch back to your `Devops_Admin` user to regain full permissions.


✅ **Result:**  
You now have two properly configured IAM users —  
- **`Devops_Admin`** → Full administrative access  
- **`teja` (Developers group)** → Read-only access across EC2, S3, and IAM

---

### **Step 6: Enable MFA for Extra Security**
1. Back in IAM → select your `devops-admin` user.  
2. Go to **Security credentials → Assign MFA device.**
