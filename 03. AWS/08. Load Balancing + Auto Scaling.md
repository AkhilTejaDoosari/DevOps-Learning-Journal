<summary><strong>1. Why We Need Load Balancing & Auto Scaling</strong></summary>

When an application runs on a single EC2 instance, it’s vulnerable — if that instance fails, users face downtime.  
As traffic grows, that single instance also becomes a bottleneck.

**Load Balancing** prevents overload by distributing requests across multiple servers.  
**Auto Scaling** ensures the number of servers adjusts automatically with demand.

Together, they create systems that are:
- **Highly available** – no single point of failure  
- **Scalable** – adapt to load changes  
- **Cost-efficient** – run only what’s needed  

**Analogy:**  
Think of a restaurant during lunch hour. The manager (Load Balancer) sends customers evenly to free tables,  
and when the rush increases, new waiters are called in (Auto Scaling).  
When it’s quiet again, the extra waiters leave — smooth, efficient, and balanced.

<summary><strong>2. Load Balancer – The Traffic Director</strong></summary>

### Purpose
A Load Balancer acts as a **single entry point** for all users, forwarding requests to backend EC2 instances that are healthy and available.

### How It Works
1. Users connect to the LB’s DNS name.  
2. The LB routes each request to a **Target Group** (group of EC2 instances or IPs).  
3. Constant **Health Checks** decide which targets are fit to receive traffic.  
4. The LB automatically stops sending traffic to unhealthy instances.

### Core Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Listener** | Defines protocol and port (e.g., HTTP 80 → Target Group A) |
| **Target Group** | Pool of EC2 targets behind the LB |
| **Rule** | Conditions (path/host/header) used for routing |
| **Cross-Zone LB** | Balances traffic across AZs for fault tolerance |
| **Sticky Sessions** | Keeps a client bound to the same target |
| **TLS Termination** | LB handles HTTPS encryption via ACM certificate |
| **Access Logs** | Store detailed connection data to S3 |

### Simple Architecture

<summary><strong>3. AWS Load Balancer Types (Deep Clarity + Scenarios)</strong></summary>

Each LB type works at a specific **OSI layer** and fits different needs.

| Type | OSI Layer | Think of It As | Ideal For | Why It Fits Best |
|------|------------|----------------|------------|------------------|
| **Application LB (ALB)** | Layer 7 | Smart receptionist who understands full sentences | Web apps (HTTP/HTTPS) | Routes by path/host, supports cookies, redirects, WebSockets, and integrates with ACM & WAF. |
| **Network LB (NLB)** | Layer 4 | Bouncer who checks connection tickets | Gaming, IoT, low-latency or fixed-IP workloads | Handles millions of TCP/UDP connections with static IPs and TLS pass-through. |
| **Gateway LB (GWLB)** | Layer 3 | Security checkpoint inspecting every packet | Firewalls, intrusion detection, network inspection | Transparently inserts appliances into traffic flow. |
| **Classic LB (CLB)** | Layer 4/7 | Old front-desk operator | Legacy EC2 stacks | Simple, but lacks advanced routing and metrics — migrate to ALB/NLB. |

---

#### Real-World Scenarios

| Scenario | Best LB | Why This Works |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Multi-path web app (`/`, `/api`, `/login`) | **ALB** | Path-based routing, SSL termination, WAF support. |
| Multiplayer gaming needing static IPs | **NLB** | TCP/UDP speed, minimal latency. |
| Deploying network firewalls (FortiGate, Palo Alto) | **GWLB** | Inserts inspection appliances inline transparently. |
| Legacy monolith (pre-2016) | **CLB → ALB recommended** | Backward compatible, but ALB adds performance & logs. |

---

#### OSI Layer Quick View

| Layer | Understands | Example Decision |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **L3 (GWLB)** | IP Packets | “Route 10.0.0.0/16 through firewall.” |
| **L4 (NLB)** | Ports & Protocols | “If TCP 443 → EC2-A.” |
| **L7 (ALB)** | Full HTTP/HTTPS requests | “If path = /api → Target Group 2.” |

---

#### Choosing Quickly

| Goal | Choose |
|------|---------|
| Smart routing (URLs, headers) | **ALB** |
| Ultra-low latency or static IP | **NLB** |
| Security inspection | **GWLB** |
| Legacy support | **CLB** |

<summary><strong>4. Health Checks Explained</strong></summary>

Health Checks are what keep your Load Balancer smart — it constantly asks,  
“Are you okay?” to each target before sending traffic.

**Parameters to Configure**
- **Protocol & Path** → `HTTP:80 /healthz` or `TCP:22`  
- **Healthy Threshold** → How many successes before marking healthy  
- **Unhealthy Threshold** → Failures before removing instance  
- **Interval** → Frequency of checks  
- **Timeout** → Wait time before declaring failure  

**Goal:** keep traffic flowing only to **healthy** instances automatically.

<summary><strong>5. Auto Scaling – The Self-Healing Mechanism</strong></summary>

When traffic rises, add servers; when it drops, remove them.  
That’s what Auto Scaling does — **scale dynamically without manual control.**

### Core Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Launch Template** | Blueprint defining AMI, instance type, SGs, IAM role, User Data |
| **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** | Logical group controlling instance count (Min/Desired/Max) |
| **Scaling Policies** | Define how and when scaling occurs |
| **Health Checks** | Replace unhealthy instances automatically |
| **Lifecycle Hooks** | Trigger actions before join/after terminate (warm-up, drain, save logs) |

### Analogy
Like a supermarket opening more checkout counters when queues form  
and closing them when the rush ends — smooth, elastic, cost-efficient.

<summary><strong>6. Scaling Policies</strong></summary>

| Policy Type | Trigger | Example |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Target Tracking** | Maintain a steady metric | Keep CPU ≈ 60 % |
| **Step Scaling** | Adjust by threshold steps | +1 instance @ 70 %, +2 @ 90 % |
| **Simple Scaling** | One threshold → one action | Add 1 instance when CPU > 80 % |
| **Scheduled Scaling** | Time-based automation | Weekdays 9 AM scale out, 5 PM scale in |

**Behind the Scenes**
- Scaling uses **CloudWatch Alarms** to detect thresholds.  
- ASG then launches or terminates instances based on that metric.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>7. Monitoring with CloudWatch</strong></summary>

**CloudWatch** provides full observability:

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| **Metrics** | CPU, Network, RequestCountPerTarget, TargetResponseTime |
| **Alarms** | Trigger actions or notifications |
| **Logs** | Collect system/app logs |
| **Dashboards** | Unified view of health and scaling metrics |

Combine these with scaling policies for a closed feedback loop:  
*Monitor → Decide → Act → Repeat.*

<summary><strong>8. Recommended Architecture Pattern</strong></summary>

**Goal:** High availability + elastic scaling + cost efficiency.

```

- Instances spread across multiple AZs  
- Health Checks at ALB and EC2 level  
- Scaling based on CPU or RequestCountPerTarget  
- Instance Refresh for rolling updates  
- Logging + Alerts via CloudWatch

<summary><strong>9. Cost Awareness</strong></summary>

| Component | Cost Basis | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| **ALB** | per hour + per LCU (Load Balancer Capacity Unit) | Pay for time active + processed traffic |
| **NLB** | per hour + per LCU (new connections, data processed) | Slightly higher but faster |
| **ASG** | Free | Pay only for EC2 and CloudWatch usage |
| **CloudWatch** | per metric + alarms + logs | Optimize by filtering important metrics only |

**Tip:**  
Right-size instance types and schedule down-scaling windows to reduce bills.

<summary><strong>10. Benefits Recap</strong></summary>

| Capability | Handled By | Outcome |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Traffic Distribution | Load Balancer | Balanced user experience |
| Fault Tolerance | LB + ASG | Automatic recovery from failures |
| Cost Efficiency | ASG | Scales down when idle |
| Security & Monitoring | WAF + CloudWatch | Visibility and Protection |

Together they build **resilient, self-adjusting AWS architectures.**

<summary><strong>11. Hands-On Pointers</strong></summary>

1. Deploy **ALB** in public subnets; register EC2 targets in private subnets.  
2. Create **Launch Template** → link to ASG → attach scaling policy.  
3. Configure Health Checks (`/healthz`) and grace periods.  
4. Use **ACM** for free SSL/TLS certificates.  
5. Verify metrics in **CloudWatch Dashboard**.  
6. Test scaling by generating load (e.g., Apache Bench or stress tool).
