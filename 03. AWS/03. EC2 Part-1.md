<summary><strong>1. EC2 Basics</strong></summary>

## 1.1 What is EC2?
EC2 stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud**. It is AWS’s service for creating virtual machines in the cloud.  

Think of it like renting a computer from AWS:
- You choose how much **RAM**, **CPU power**, and **storage** you want.  
- You can increase or decrease these resources as your workload changes (scalable).  

👉 Use cases:  
- Hosting a website  
- Running applications (databases, APIs, ML workloads)  
- Creating testing/development environments  

---

## 1.2 Billing and Pricing
AWS charges you based on **how long your EC2 instance is running**.  

- **Linux instances** → billed **per second** (minimum 60 seconds).  
- **Windows instances** → billed **per hour**.  

📌 Example:  
If you start a Linux instance at 10:00:00 and stop at 10:02:15, you are billed for **135 seconds**.  
For Windows, if you run for even 5 minutes, you are billed for the full **1 hour**.  

---

## 1.3 Free Tier EC2
AWS provides a **Free Tier** for new accounts:  
- 750 hours/month of EC2 usage for 12 months  
- Enough to run **one instance continuously** for the whole month  

Free instance types:  
- `t2.micro` → older, available in Asia regions  
- `t3.micro` → newer, available in US & Europe  

📌 Example: You can launch a free Ubuntu server (`t2.micro`) and practice hosting a small website.  

---

## 1.4 Storage and RAM Defaults
Every EC2 instance needs a **hard disk** to store the operating system and files. AWS uses **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** for this.  

- Default root volume sizes:  
  - Linux → **8 GB**  
  - Windows → **30 GB**  

⚠️ Important: The **RAM** is decided by the **instance type**, not the OS.  
- Example: `t2.micro` = 1 GB RAM, `t3.medium` = 4 GB RAM.  

📌 Analogy: Think of EBS as your **hard drive**, and RAM as your **computer’s memory** — two different things.  

---

## 1.5 Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
An **AMI** is like a **template** for your EC2 instance. It contains:  
- The operating system (Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, etc.)  
- Pre-installed software (optional)  
- Default settings  

📌 Example:  
- Want a Linux server? → Choose Ubuntu AMI  
- Want a Windows desktop? → Choose Windows AMI  

---

## 1.6 Instance Types
AWS offers **different categories of instances** depending on what you need:  
- **General Purpose** → balanced (web apps)  
- **Compute Optimized** → more CPU (batch processing)  
- **Memory Optimized** → more RAM (databases, analytics)  
- **GPU Instances** → for ML, AI, gaming  

Free Tier examples:  

| Instance | Region      | Free Tier |  
|----------|-------------|-----------|  
| t2.micro | Asia        | Yes       |  
| t3.micro | US, Europe  | Yes       |  

📌 Example: If you just want to practice Linux commands, you don’t need GPU/memory-heavy instances — `t2.micro` is enough.  

---

## 1.7 Key Pair
When you connect to your EC2 via SSH (Linux/Mac) or RDP (Windows), AWS uses **Key Pairs** for authentication.  

- You download a **private key file** when you create the key pair:  
  - On Linux/Mac: `.pem` file  
  - On Windows (PuTTY): `.ppk` file (converted from `.pem`)  
- The **public key** is stored inside the EC2 instance automatically.  
- Together they work like a **lock and key system**.  

📌 Secure the private key with:  
```bash
chmod 400 mykey.pem
````

Without correct permissions, SSH won’t connect.

---

### 🔑 Key Pair Authentication Flow

```
[ Your PC ] -- uses private key --> [ SSH Request ] ---> [ EC2 Instance ]
                                           |
                                           v
                              EC2 compares with public key
                                           |
                       +-------------------+-----------------+
                       | Match? YES -> Access Granted        |
                       | Match? NO  -> Access Denied         |
                       +-------------------------------------+
```

## 1.8 Security Groups

A **Security Group** is like a **firewall** that controls traffic to and from your EC2 instance.

* **Inbound rules** → define what traffic can come **into** the instance
* **Outbound rules** → define what traffic can leave (default = all allowed)
* **Stateful** → if inbound is allowed, the reply outbound is automatically allowed

✔️ Common rules:

* Allow HTTP (port 80) → normal websites
* Allow HTTPS (port 443) → secure websites
* Allow SSH (port 22) → remote login

📌 Example:

* Hosting a website? → Open port 80 and 443 inbound
* Need remote login? → Open port 22 for your IP

<summary><strong>2. IP Types</strong></summary>

### 2.1 Private IP

* Assigned automatically when you launch an EC2 instance inside a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**.
* **Fixed while running**, but it **changes if you stop and start** the instance.
* Used for **internal communication** between resources in the same VPC.
* Not routable on the internet.

---

### 2.2 Public IP

* Automatically assigned by AWS to instances launched in a **public subnet**.
* **Dynamic** → changes every time you stop and start the instance.
* Used for **internet communication**.
* Free, but **temporary**.

---

### 2.3 Elastic IP

* A **static public IPv4 address**.
* Remains the same until you manually release it.
* Useful for **production servers** that need a fixed public identity.
* Free if associated with a running instance; **chargeable if idle**.

**Workflow**

1. Allocate Elastic IP → Associate with EC2 instance.
2. Deallocate if not in use to avoid charges.

---

**Comparison Table**

| IP Type    | Static/Dynamic   | Scope           | Cost             | Notes                   |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Private IP | Static (per run) | Internal (VPC)  | Free             | Changes on stop/start   |
| Public IP  | Dynamic          | Internet access | Free             | New IP every stop/start |
| Elastic IP | Static           | Internet access | Free if attached | Permanent Public IP     |

<summary><strong>3. Elastic Block Store (EBS)</strong></summary>

### 3.1 What is EBS?

* **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is block-level storage used with EC2 instances.
* Works like a **virtual hard disk (HDD/SSD)**.
* Persistent → data survives instance stop/start.
* Each EC2 instance must have at least **one root volume** (boot disk).

---

### 3.2 EBS Volumes

* Root volume → default OS storage.

  * Linux default: **8 GiB**
  * Windows default: **30 GiB**
* Additional volumes can be attached/detached.
* Volume size → up to **16 TiB**.
* One EC2 instance can have **multiple volumes**.

---

### 3.3 Types of EBS Volumes

| Type                               | Description                      | Use Case            | Min Size | Max Size |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| **gp3 (General Purpose SSD)**      | Balanced performance & price     | General workloads   | 1 GiB    | 16 TiB   |
| **io2/io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)** | High performance, low latency    | Databases           | 4 GiB    | 16 TiB   |
| **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)** | Low-cost HDD, high throughput    | Big data, streaming | 125 GiB  | 16 TiB   |
| **sc1 (Cold HDD)**                 | Cheapest HDD, lowest performance | Archival data       | 125 GiB  | 16 TiB   |
| **Magnetic (Standard)**            | Legacy HDD                       | Rarely used         | 1 GiB    | 1 TiB    |

---

### 3.4 Example – Using Additional Volumes Across Instances

#### Step 1: Store Data into the Additional Volume

```bash
# Format the new volume
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdbb

# Create a directory to mount
mkdir telusko

# Mount the volume
sudo mount /dev/xvdbb telusko

# Go inside the mount directory
cd telusko

# Create files inside the new volume
sudo touch telusko.txt alien.txt
```

At this point, your extra volume (`/dev/xvdbb`) contains 2 files.

---

#### Step 2: Detach Additional Volume

* From the AWS console, **detach the additional volume** from the current EC2 VM.

---

#### Step 3: Attach Volume to Another Instance

1. Create a **new EC2 VM**.
2. Attach the same additional volume (`/dev/xvdbb`) to the new VM.

---

#### Step 4: Verify Data in New Instance

```bash
# Check available block devices
lsblk

# Create mount point again
mkdir telusko

# Mount the existing volume
sudo mount /dev/xvdbb telusko

# Go inside and list files
cd telusko
ls -l
```

📌 You should see the files created earlier:

```
telusko.txt
alien.txt
```

---

#### Step 5: Cleanup

* Once done with practice, **detach the additional volumes**.
* Delete the volume from AWS console if no longer needed.

---

### 📊 Visual

```
[ EC2 Instance A ] --> Volume (/dev/xvdbb) --> Files: telusko.txt, alien.txt
       |
   Detach Volume
       v
[ EC2 Instance B ] <-- Attach same volume <-- Files still available
```
