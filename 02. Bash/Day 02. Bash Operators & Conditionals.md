### Theory & Notes

#### Comparison Operators

These are used for comparing numerical values inside `if` statements.

- `-eq`: Equal to  
- `-ne`: Not equal to  
- `-lt`: Less than  
- `-le`: Less than or equal to  
- `-gt`: Greater than  
- `-ge`: Greater than or equal to  

#### String Comparison Operators

Used for comparing strings. For ASCII alphabetical order (`<` and `>`), use `[[ ]]` instead of `[ ]`.

- `=`: Equal to  
- `!=`: Not equal to  
- `<`: Less than, in ASCII alphabetical order  
- `>`: Greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order  

#### Arithmetic Operators

Perform mathematical calculations within `$((...))`.

- `+`: Addition  
- `-`: Subtraction  
- `*`: Multiplication  
- `/`: Division  
- `%`: Modulus (remainder)  

#### Logical Operators

Combine multiple conditions.

- `&&`: Logical AND  
- `||`: Logical OR  
- `!`: Logical NOT  

#### File Test Operators

Check attributes of files and directories.

- `-e`: Checks if a file exists  
- `-d`: Checks if a directory exists  
- `-f`: Checks if a regular file exists  
- `-s`: Checks if a file is not empty  

### Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# A) Comparison & Logical
num1=15
num2=10
if [ $num1 -gt 10 ] && [ $num2 -lt 15 ]; then
  echo "Both conditions are true."
fi

# B) String Comparison
string1="apple"
string2="banana"
if [ "$string1" != "$string2" ]; then
  echo "Strings are not equal."
fi

# C) File Test
file="example.txt"
touch "$file"
if [ -e "$file" ]; then
  echo "File exists."
fi
rm "$file"
````

```output
Both conditions are true.
Strings are not equal.
File exists.
```

| Operator   | Purpose                         | Example                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `-eq`      | Numeric equality                | `[ $num -eq 10 ]`        |
| `=`        | String equality                 | `[ "$name" = "user" ]`   |
| `&&`       | Logical AND                     | `[ cond1 ] && [ cond2 ]` |
| `[[ < ]]`  | String less than (alphabetical) | `[[ "a" < "b" ]]`        |
| `-f`       | Test for regular file           | `[ -f "/etc/passwd" ]`   |
| `$((...))` | Arithmetic expression           | `sum=$((num1 + num2))`   |

<summary><strong>2. Bash If...Else Statements</strong></summary>

### Theory & Notes

* **`if` statement:** Executes a block of code if a condition is true. The condition is enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`, and the block ends with `fi`.
* **`if...else` statement:** Executes a different block of code if the initial condition is false. The alternative block is introduced by `else`.
* **`elif` statement:** Allows checking multiple conditions in sequence. If the first condition is false, the next `elif` is checked.
* **Nested `if` statements:** An `if` can be placed inside another `if` for more complex logic. Each block must be closed with `fi`.

### Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# 1) If Statement
num=15
if [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 10"
fi

# 2) If...Else Statement
num=8
if [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 10"
else
  echo "Number is 10 or less"
fi

# 3) If...Elif...Else Statement
num=10
if [ "$num" -gt 10 ]; then
  echo "Number is greater than 10"
elif [ "$num" -eq 10 ]; then
  echo "Number is exactly 10"
else
  echo "Number is less than 10"
fi

# 4) Nested If Statement
num=5
if [ "$num" -gt 0 ]; then
  if [ "$num" -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is between 1 and 9"
  fi
fi
```

```output
Number is greater than 10
Number is 10 or less
Number is exactly 10
Number is between 1 and 9
```

| Command              | Purpose                      | Example               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `if [ condition ]`   | Start conditional block      | `if [ $num -eq 10 ]`  |
| `then`               | Mark start of code block     | N/A                   |
| `else`               | Start alternative code block | N/A                   |
| `elif [ condition ]` | Check a secondary condition  | `elif [ $num -gt 5 ]` |
| `fi`                 | End conditional block        | N/A                   |
