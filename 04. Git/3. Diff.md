# Diff, Stash, and Tags in Git  

This guide covers essential Git commands for comparing changes, stashing work, and managing tags. These commands are useful for debugging, context switching, and release management.  

## Git Diff  

The `git diff` command shows differences between commits, branches, or files. It compares changes line by line.  

### How to Read Diff Output  
- `a/` ‚Äì Original file (before changes)  
- `b/` ‚Äì Updated file (after changes)  
- `---` ‚Äì Marks the original file  
- `+++` ‚Äì Marks the updated file  
- `@@` ‚Äì Line numbers and change positions  

### Common Use Cases  
1. **Unstaged Changes (Working Directory vs Staging Area):**  
   ```bash  
   git diff  
   ```  

2. **Staged Changes (Staging Area vs Repository):**  
   ```bash  
   git diff --staged  
   ```  

3. **Compare Two Branches:**  
   ```bash  
   git diff branch1 branch2  
   # Or:  
   git diff branch1..branch2  
   ```  

4. **Compare Specific Commits:**  
   ```bash  
   git diff commit-hash-1 commit-hash-2  
   ```

## Git Stash (Modern Workflow)

### 1. `git stash push` (Save Changes)
```bash
git stash push -m "description"  # Always add a message
```
- Saves both staged/unstaged changes
- Workspace reverts to last commit (`HEAD`)
- üîπ **Replaces old `git stash save`**

### 2. `git stash list` (View Stashes)
```bash
git stash list
```
- Shows stack of stashes (newest = `stash@{0}`)
- Example output:
  ```
  stash@{0}: On main: login page WIP
  stash@{1}: On dev: dark mode experiment
  ```

### 3. `git stash apply` (Reapply Safely)
```bash
git stash apply stash@{n}  # Default: latest (stash@{0})
```
- ‚úÖ **Keeps** the stash in list
- Use when you might need the stash again

### 4. `git stash pop` (Apply + Delete)
```bash
git stash pop stash@{n}  # Default: latest
```
- ‚úÖ Applies changes  
- ‚ùå **Deletes** the stash  
- Riskier - use only when sure!

## üßπ Cleanup Commands

### 5. Delete Specific Stash
```bash
git stash drop stash@{1}
```

### 6. Delete ALL Stashes
```bash
git stash clear  # Irreversible!
```

## üí° Key Differences: Apply vs Pop
| Command          | Reapplies? | Keeps Stash? | Best For                  |
|------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `git stash apply`| ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚úÖ Yes       | Testing changes          |
| `git stash pop`  | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚ùå No        | One-time use + cleanup   |

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Example
1. When interrupted:
   ```bash
   git stash push -m "navbar responsiveness fixes"
   ```
2. After switching back:
   ```bash
   git stash apply  # Test changes
   git stash pop    # Apply + delete (if everything works)
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pro Tip**: Stashes are **local-only** and expire after 90 days by default!

## Git Tags  

Tags mark specific commits (e.g., releases).  

### Key Commands  
- **Create a Lightweight Tag:**  
  ```bash  
  git tag v1.0  
  ```  

- **Create an Annotated Tag:**  
  ```bash  
  git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release 1.0"  
  ```  

- **List Tags:**  
  ```bash  
  git tag  
  ```  

- **Tag a Specific Commit:**  
  ```bash  
  git tag v1.0 commit-hash  
  ```  

- **Push Tags to Remote:**  
  ```bash  
  git push origin v1.0  
  ```  

- **Delete Tags:**  
  ```bash  
  git tag -d v1.0                  # Local  
  git push origin :v1.0            # Remote  
  ```

### Notes:  
1. The content is strictly from the PDF, organized into sections (`Diff`, `Stash`, `Tags`) with code blocks and bullet points for clarity.  
2. Headers and structure mirror the reference files (e.g., `##` for subsections, `###` for sub-subsections).  
3. No external links or images (unlike the PDF) to match the reference files' style.
