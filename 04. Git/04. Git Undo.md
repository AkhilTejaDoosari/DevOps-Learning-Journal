# 🐧 Git Undo – Part 1: Git Revert  

---

## Why do we need Git Revert?  

Sometimes you make a commit and later realize:  
- You added the wrong code.  
- You broke something.  
- You need to roll it back, but without deleting history.  

👉 In these cases, `git revert` is the safest way to undo because it **creates a new commit that cancels out the changes** of the bad commit.  
It does **not erase history**, so it works perfectly in shared repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).  

*Analogy:* Imagine you wrote something wrong in ink on a whiteboard. Instead of erasing the entire board (losing history), you add a **new note** that says “Ignore the previous line.” Everyone still sees the history, but also sees the correction.  

---

## How does Git Revert work?  

- Finds the commit you want to undo.  
- Creates a **new commit** that reverses that commit’s changes.  
- Keeps commit history intact.  

---

## Basic Commands  

| Command | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `git revert HEAD` | Revert the latest commit |
| `git revert <commit_id>` | Revert a specific commit |
| `git revert HEAD~2` | Revert a commit two steps back |
| `git revert --no-edit` | Skip opening commit message editor |
| `git log --oneline` | Show commit history to find commits |

---

## Step 1: Find the Commit  

Use `git log --oneline` to see recent commits:  

```bash
git log --oneline
52418f7 (HEAD -> master) Just a regular update, definitely no accidents here...
9a9add8 (origin/master) Added .gitignore
81912ba Corrected spelling error
3fdaa5b Merge pull request #1 from update-readme
...
````

Copy the **commit ID** you want to undo.

---

## Step 2: Run Git Revert

Revert the latest commit:

```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
```

**Output example:**

```output
[master e56ba1f] Revert "Just a regular update, definitely no accidents here..."
 Date: Thu Apr 22 10:50:13 2021 +0200
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 img_hello_git.jpg
```

This created a **new commit** that reversed the bad one.

---

## Step 3: Review Changes

Check commit history again:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Example result:

```output
e56ba1f (HEAD -> master) Revert "Just a regular update, definitely no accidents here..."
52418f7 Just a regular update, definitely no accidents here...
9a9add8 (origin/master) Added .gitignore
...
```

Notice:

* The **bad commit** is still there (history preserved).
* But now there’s a new commit that cancels it out.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

* ✅ Use **`git revert`** instead of `git reset` in **shared repos** to keep history clean.
* ✅ Use `git log --oneline` to quickly find commit IDs.
* ✅ Use `--no-edit` if you don’t want to edit the default revert message.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Problem:** `error: could not revert...`

  * Run:

    ```bash
    git revert --abort
    ```

    (Abort the revert process.)

* **Problem:** `error: could not apply...`

  * Run:

    ```bash
    git revert --continue
    ```

    (Continue after resolving conflicts.)

---

## When to use Git Revert?

* When you want to **undo a commit** but keep project history intact.
* Safe for **collaborative projects** on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
* Best choice when you don’t want to **rewrite history**.

✅ Now your **Git Revert** notes are:  
- Beginner-friendly with analogy (whiteboard ink correction).  
- Structured in steps (Find commit → Revert → Review).  
- Includes commands, outputs, tips, and troubleshooting.  

Do you want me to move on to **Git Reset** next in the same pattern?
