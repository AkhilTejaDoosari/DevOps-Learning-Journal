<summary><strong>1. Why Every Access Issue Is a Permission Issue</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

## The Reality

**Every "permission denied" error traces back to permissions.**

Common scenarios:
- "Script won't execute" → missing execute permission
- "Nginx can't serve files" → wrong ownership
- "Can't write to shared directory" → group permissions wrong
- "SSH key rejected" → permissions too open

**Understanding permissions = fixing access issues instantly.**

---

## The Scenarios You'll Face

**At 2 AM:**
- "Application can't read config file"
- "User can't write to log directory"
- "Backup script failing with permission denied"

**During onboarding:**
- "New developer needs access to /var/www"
- "Shared project directory for team"
- "Service account for application"

**Security incident:**
- "Lock down sensitive files immediately"
- "Audit who can access secrets"
- "Restrict temp directory access"

---

## What Most People Get Wrong

They see `-rwxr-xr-x` and think it's magic numbers.

**It's not. It's a simple pattern:**
- First 3 chars = owner permissions
- Next 3 chars = group permissions
- Last 3 chars = everyone else

**After this file, permissions will click.**

<summary><strong>2. The Permission Model (Owner, Group, Others)</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

## Three Layers of Access

**Every file has:**
1. **Owner** (one user)
2. **Group** (one group)
3. **Others** (everyone else)

**Each layer gets different permissions.**

---

## How the Kernel Decides

```
You try to access file.txt
     ↓
Are you the owner?
     ↓ Yes: Use owner permissions
     ↓ No: Continue
     ↓
Are you in the file's group?
     ↓ Yes: Use group permissions
     ↓ No: Continue
     ↓
Use "others" permissions
```

**First match wins. Order matters.**

---

## The Permission String Decoded

```bash
ls -l file.txt
# Output: -rw-r--r-- 1 john developers 1234 Jan 15 file.txt
```

**Breaking it down:**

```
-rw-r--r--
│└┬┘└┬┘└┬┘
│ │  │  └─ others: r-- (read only)
│ │  └──── group:  r-- (read only)
│ └─────── owner:  rw- (read + write)
└───────── type:   - (regular file)
```

**So:**
- john (owner) can read and write
- developers (group) can only read
- Everyone else can only read

---

## Key Insight: You're Not Always in the Group Slot

**Even if you're in the file's group, you might use owner permissions!**

Example:
```bash
-rw-r----- 1 john developers file.txt
```

**If john tries to access:**
- john IS the owner → uses `rw-` (owner permissions)
- john is NOT checked against group permissions
- john gets read+write

**If sarah is in developers group:**
- sarah is NOT the owner → continues
- sarah IS in developers → uses `r--` (group permissions)
- sarah gets read only

**Owner permissions always take precedence over group.**

---

## Real Scenario: Permission Confusion

```bash
$ cat /var/log/app.log
Permission denied
```

**Check it:**
```bash
ls -l /var/log/app.log
# -rw-r----- 1 appuser appuser 12345 Jan 15 app.log
```

**Breakdown:**
- Owner: appuser (rw-)
- Group: appuser (r--)
- Others: --- (nothing)

**If you're not appuser and not in appuser group, you can't read it.**

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo chmod 644 /var/log/app.log
# Now: -rw-r--r-- (everyone can read)
```

<div style="margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

## For Files

| Permission | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **r** (read) | View file contents |
| **w** (write) | Modify file contents |
| **x** (execute) | Run as program/script |

**Examples:**

```bash
-rw-r--r--  # Owner can edit, everyone can read
-rwxr-xr-x  # Owner can edit, everyone can run
-rw-------  # Owner only (secrets, keys)
```

---

## For Directories (Different Rules!)

| Permission | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **r** (read) | List contents (ls) |
| **w** (write) | Create/delete files inside |
| **x** (execute) | Enter directory (cd) |

**Critical difference:**
- File x = run as program
- Directory x = enter the directory

---

## Directory Permission Scenarios

### **rwxr-xr-x (755) — Standard directory**
```bash
drwxr-xr-x john developers /var/www
```
- john: full access
- developers: can cd and list, can't create files
- others: can cd and list, can't create files

### **rwxrwx--- (770) — Team directory**
```bash
drwxrwx--- john developers /shared/project
```
- john: full access
- developers: full access
- others: can't even see it exists

### **rwx------ (700) — Private directory**
```bash
drwx------ john john /home/john/.ssh
```
- Only john can access
- Nobody else can even ls it

---

## The Weird Combinations

### **r-- without x**
```bash
dr--r--r-- john john /strange
```
**You can list files but can't cd into it or access them.**
```bash
ls /strange  # Works
cd /strange  # Permission denied
cat /strange/file.txt  # Permission denied
```

### **--x without r**
```bash
d--x--x--x john john /secret
```
**You can cd if you know the path, but can't list contents.**
```bash
ls /secret  # Permission denied
cd /secret  # Works!
cat /secret/known_file.txt  # Works if you know the filename
```

**Rarely useful. Mostly just confusing.**

---

## The Octal Numbers

**Each permission set = 3 bits = 1 octal digit**

| Octal | Binary | rwx | Meaning |
|-------|--------|-----|---------|
| 0 | 000 | --- | Nothing |
| 1 | 001 | --x | Execute only |
| 2 | 010 | -w- | Write only |
| 3 | 011 | -wx | Write + execute |
| 4 | 100 | r-- | Read only |
| 5 | 101 | r-x | Read + execute |
| 6 | 110 | rw- | Read + write |
| 7 | 111 | rwx | Full access |

**How to calculate:**
```
r = 4
w = 2
x = 1

rw- = 4+2 = 6
r-x = 4+1 = 5
rwx = 4+2+1 = 7
```

---

## Common Patterns You'll Use

**Files:**
- **644** (`rw-r--r--`) — Standard file (owner edits, others read)
- **600** (`rw-------`) — Private file (secrets, keys)
- **755** (`rwxr-xr-x`) — Executable (scripts, binaries)

**Directories:**
- **755** (`rwxr-xr-x`) — Standard directory
- **775** (`rwxrwxr-x`) — Team directory
- **700** (`rwx------`) — Private directory

**Never use 777 unless you have a very good reason.**

<summary><strong>4. chmod: Changing Permissions</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

## Two Ways to Change Permissions

**1. Symbolic** (add/remove specific permissions)  
**2. Octal** (set exact permissions)

---

## Symbolic Mode: Surgical Changes

**Add permission:**
```bash
chmod u+x script.sh      # Owner gets execute
chmod g+w file.txt       # Group gets write
chmod o+r file.txt       # Others get read
chmod a+x script.sh      # All (everyone) gets execute
```

**Remove permission:**
```bash
chmod u-x script.sh      # Owner loses execute
chmod g-w file.txt       # Group loses write
chmod o-r file.txt       # Others lose read
```

**Set exact permission:**
```bash
chmod u=rw file.txt      # Owner gets ONLY read+write
chmod g=r file.txt       # Group gets ONLY read
chmod o= file.txt        # Others get nothing
```

**Symbols:**
- **u** = user (owner)
- **g** = group
- **o** = others
- **a** = all (everyone)

---

## Octal Mode: Set Everything At Once

```bash
chmod 644 file.txt       # rw-r--r--
chmod 755 script.sh      # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 600 secret.key     # rw-------
chmod 700 private/       # rwx------
```

**Formula:**
```
Owner Group Others
  6     4     4    = 644

Owner: rw- (4+2=6)
Group: r-- (4=4)
Others: r-- (4=4)
```

---

## Recursive: Change Everything Inside

```bash
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
# Sets 755 on directory AND all files inside
```

**Use with caution.** This affects everything.

---

## Real Scenarios

### **Make script executable**
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
# or
chmod 755 deploy.sh
```

### **Secure SSH key**
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### **Team project directory**
```bash
chmod 775 /shared/project
```

### **Private config file**
```bash
chmod 600 /etc/myapp/secrets.conf
```

---

## Pro Tip: Check Before Changing

```bash
ls -l file.txt
# See current permissions

chmod 644 file.txt
# Change it

ls -l file.txt
# Verify it worked
```

---

## Key Takeaway

**Symbolic (+/-/=) = add/remove specific permissions**  
**Octal (644, 755) = set exact permissions**  
**-R = recursive (directories and contents)**

<summary><strong>5. chown: Changing Ownership</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

## Changing Owner and Group

**Change owner only:**
```bash
sudo chown john file.txt
```

**Change owner and group:**
```bash
sudo chown john:developers file.txt
```

**Change group only:**
```bash
sudo chgrp developers file.txt
# or
sudo chown :developers file.txt
```

**Recursive:**
```bash
sudo chown -R john:developers /var/www/html
# Changes directory and everything inside
```

---

## Why sudo?

**Only root (or file owner in some cases) can change ownership.**

**Security reason:** Prevents users from giving files away to avoid quotas or security policies.

---

## Real Scenarios

### **Web server directory**
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
# nginx/apache user can now read/write
```

### **Application deployment**
```bash
sudo chown -R appuser:appuser /opt/myapp
# App runs as appuser, needs ownership
```

### **Fix "permission denied" on uploaded file**
```bash
sudo chown john:john uploaded_file.txt
# Now john owns it
```

### **Shared project ownership**
```bash
sudo chown -R :developers /shared/project
# Changes group to developers for entire tree
```

---

## Checking Current Ownership

```bash
ls -l file.txt
# -rw-r--r-- 1 john developers ...
#                ↑     ↑
#              owner  group
```

```bash
stat file.txt
# More detailed ownership info
```

---

## Key Takeaway

**chown user:group file** = change both  
**chown user file** = change owner only  
**chown :group file** = change group only  
**-R** = recursive (directory trees)

<summary><strong>6. Special Permissions (SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit)</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

## Beyond rwx: Three Special Bits

**SUID** (Set User ID) — executable runs as file owner  
**SGID** (Set Group ID) — directory makes files inherit group  
**Sticky Bit** — directory protects files from deletion

---

## SUID: Run as Owner

**What it does:**
Executable runs with file owner's privileges, not yours.

**Example:**
```bash
ls -l /usr/bin/passwd
# -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root ...
#     ↑ 's' instead of 'x'
```

**Why `/usr/bin/passwd` needs SUID:**
- You (normal user) run `passwd` to change your password
- But password hashes are in `/etc/shadow` (root-only file)
- SUID lets passwd run as root temporarily
- You change your password successfully

**Setting SUID:**
```bash
chmod u+s executable
# or
chmod 4755 executable
```

**Security warning:** SUID executables are powerful. If owner is root and the program is vulnerable, big security risk.

---

## SGID: Inherit Group (For Directories)

**What it does on directories:**
New files inherit the directory's group (not creator's primary group).

**Perfect for team directories.**

**Example:**
```bash
sudo mkdir /shared/project
sudo chgrp developers /shared/project
sudo chmod 2775 /shared/project
```

**Check it:**
```bash
ls -ld /shared/project
# drwxrwsr-x ... developers
#       ↑ 's' in group position
```

**Test it:**
```bash
cd /shared/project
touch myfile.txt
ls -l myfile.txt
# -rw-rw-r-- ... john developers
#                      ↑ inherited from directory
```

**Without SGID:**
```bash
touch myfile.txt
ls -l myfile.txt
# -rw-rw-r-- ... john john
#                      ↑ john's primary group
```

**Setting SGID:**
```bash
chmod g+s directory
# or
chmod 2775 directory
```

---

## Sticky Bit: Protect Files in Shared Directory

**What it does:**
Only file owner, directory owner, or root can delete/rename files.

**Perfect for temp directories.**

**Example: /tmp**
```bash
ls -ld /tmp
# drwxrwxrwt ... root root
#          ↑ 't' at the end
```

**Scenario:**
- Alice creates `/tmp/alice_data`
- Bob creates `/tmp/bob_data`
- Without sticky bit: Alice could delete Bob's file (both have write on /tmp)
- With sticky bit: Alice can ONLY delete her own files

**Setting sticky bit:**
```bash
chmod +t directory
# or
chmod 1777 directory
```

**Example:**
```bash
sudo mkdir /shared/temp
sudo chmod 1777 /shared/temp

ls -ld /shared/temp
# drwxrwxrwt ... (note the 't')
```

---

## Special Permissions Summary

| Bit | Octal | Where | Effect |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| **SUID** | 4xxx | Executable | Runs as file owner |
| **SGID** | 2xxx | Directory | New files inherit group |
| **Sticky** | 1xxx | Directory | Only owner can delete files |

**Examples:**
```bash
chmod 4755 script     # SUID + rwxr-xr-x
chmod 2775 dir        # SGID + rwxrwxr-x
chmod 1777 temp       # Sticky + rwxrwxrwx
```

---

## Visual Guide

**Normal execute: x**
```bash
-rwxr-xr-x
```

**SUID: s in owner position**
```bash
-rwsr-xr-x
```

**SGID: s in group position**
```bash
-rwxr-sr-x
```

**Sticky: t at the end**
```bash
drwxrwxrwt
```

**Capital letters mean execute bit not set:**
```bash
-rwSr-xr-x  # SUID but owner can't execute (rare/broken)
drwxrwxrwT  # Sticky but others can't execute (rare)
```

---

## Real Scenario: Team Project Directory

```bash
# Create shared directory
sudo mkdir /shared/team-project

# Set group ownership
sudo chgrp developers /shared/team-project

# Set permissions with SGID
sudo chmod 2775 /shared/team-project

# Now:
# - All developers can create files
# - All files inherit 'developers' group
# - Everyone on team can access each other's files
```

<summary><strong>7. Real Production Scenarios</strong></summary>

<div style="margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;">

## Scenario 1: Script Won't Execute

### **Problem:**
```bash
$ ./deploy.sh
Permission denied
```

### **Diagnosis:**
```bash
ls -l deploy.sh
# -rw-r--r-- ... (no x)
```

### **Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
# or
chmod 755 deploy.sh
```

### **Verify:**
```bash
ls -l deploy.sh
# -rwxr-xr-x ... (x is there)

./deploy.sh
# Works now
```

---

## Scenario 2: Nginx Can't Serve Files

### **Problem:**
Nginx returns 403 Forbidden for all pages.

### **Diagnosis:**
```bash
ls -ld /var/www/html
# drwx------ root root ... (nginx can't read)
```

### **Solution:**
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```

### **Verify:**
```bash
ls -ld /var/www/html
# drwxr-xr-x www-data www-data
```

---

## Scenario 3: SSH Key Permissions Too Open

### **Problem:**
```bash
$ ssh server
WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!
Permissions 0644 for '/home/john/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.
```

### **Solution:**
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

### **Verify:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
# drwx------  john john .
# -rw-------  john john id_rsa
# -rw-r--r--  john john id_rsa.pub
```

---

## Scenario 4: Team Can't Edit Shared Files

### **Problem:**
Team members get "Permission denied" editing files in `/shared/project`

### **Diagnosis:**
```bash
ls -l /shared/project/file.txt
# -rw-r--r-- john john ... (only john can write)
```

### **Solution:**
```bash
# Set up proper team directory
sudo chgrp developers /shared/project
sudo chmod 2775 /shared/project

# Fix existing files
sudo chgrp -R developers /shared/project
sudo chmod -R 664 /shared/project/*.txt
sudo chmod -R 775 /shared/project/*/
```

### **Verify:**
```bash
ls -ld /shared/project
# drwxrwsr-x ... developers (note the 's')

touch /shared/project/newfile
ls -l /shared/project/newfile
# -rw-rw-r-- john developers (inherited group)
```

---

## Scenario 5: Application Can't Read Config

### **Problem:**
```bash
$ systemctl status myapp
Config file: Permission denied
```

### **Diagnosis:**
```bash
ls -l /etc/myapp/config.yaml
# -rw------- root root ... (app runs as 'appuser')
```

### **Solution:**
```bash
sudo chown appuser:appuser /etc/myapp/config.yaml
sudo chmod 640 /etc/myapp/config.yaml
```

### **Verify:**
```bash
ls -l /etc/myapp/config.yaml
# -rw-r----- appuser appuser

systemctl restart myapp
systemctl status myapp
# Running now
```

---

## Scenario 6: Users Deleting Each Other's Temp Files

### **Problem:**
Shared temp directory, users accidentally delete each other's files.

### **Solution:**
```bash
sudo mkdir /shared/temp
sudo chmod 1777 /shared/temp
```

### **Verify:**
```bash
ls -ld /shared/temp
# drwxrwxrwt ... (note the 't')

# Test as user1:
echo "user1 data" > /shared/temp/user1_file

# Test as user2:
rm /shared/temp/user1_file
# rm: cannot remove: Operation not permitted
# Perfect! Only user1 can delete it
```

---

## Scenario 7: Log File Growing, Need to Rotate

### **Problem:**
Need to archive old log, create fresh one with correct permissions.

### **Solution:**
```bash
# Save current log
sudo mv /var/log/myapp/app.log /var/log/myapp/app.log.$(date +%F)

# Create new log with correct ownership
sudo touch /var/log/myapp/app.log
sudo chown appuser:appuser /var/log/myapp/app.log
sudo chmod 644 /var/log/myapp/app.log

# Signal app to reopen log file
sudo systemctl reload myapp
```

---

## Key Takeaway

**Check permissions first** (`ls -l`)  
**Script won't run** → `chmod +x`  
**Web server issues** → `chown www-data, chmod 755`  
**SSH key rejected** → `chmod 600`  
**Team directory** → `chmod 2775 + chgrp`  
**Shared temp** → `chmod 1777 + sticky bit`

## chmod: Changing Permissions (Symbolic)

```bash copy
chmod u+x script.sh   # owner gets execute
```

```bash copy
chmod g+w file.txt   # group gets write
```

```bash copy
chmod o+r file.txt   # others get read

## chmod: Changing Permissions (Octal)

```bash copy
chmod 644 file.txt   # rw-r--r--
```

```bash copy
chmod 755 script.sh   # rwxr-xr-x
```

```bash copy
chmod 600 secret.key   # rw-------
```

```

```bash copy
sudo chown -R john:developers directory/   # recursive
```

```bash copy
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html   # web server
```

---

## Special Permissions

```bash copy
chmod u+s executable   # set SUID
```

```bash copy
chmod g+s directory   # set SGID
```

```bash copy
chmod +t directory   # set sticky bit
```

```bash copy
chmod 4755 executable   # SUID + rwxr-xr-x
```

```bash copy
chmod 2775 directory   # SGID + rwxrwxr-x
```

```bash copy
chmod 1777 temp   # Sticky + rwxrwxrwx
```

---

## Common Permission Patterns

```bash copy
chmod 644 file.txt   # standard file (rw-r--r--)
```

```bash copy
chmod 600 secret.key   # private file (rw-------)
```

```bash copy
chmod 755 script.sh   # executable (rwxr-xr-x)
```

```bash copy
chmod 700 ~/.ssh   # SSH directory (rwx------)
```

```bash copy
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa   # SSH private key (rw-------)
```

```bash copy
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   # SSH public key (rw-r--r--)
```

```bash copy
chmod 755 directory/   # standard directory (rwxr-xr-x)
```

```bash copy
chmod 775 shared/   # team directory (rwxrwxr-x)
```
